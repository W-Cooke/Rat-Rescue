Rat Rescue!

You are the great wizard Magimagicus! One day in your tower, experimenting trying to give rats super intelligence, you fail! 

But did you?

The rats have escaped! It's up to you to and your magical net to catch them! Run through 5 handcrafted levels and catch rats within the time limit
Use stealth and line of sight to sneak up on unsuspecting rats, or chase them down! watch out if they get cornered, rats are notoriously slippery!

This game has been made as a personal project to make a game using analogue stick input as the primary form of interaction, I developed a script for detecting spinning of the analogue stick and wanted to implement it into a game
This is my first real attempt at creating a game from scratch with the goal of finishing it. Included in this Github repo is everything needed for the game to run. 
I have, where possible, commented what each code segment does, as GDScript is not a commonly used language I hope my explanations make sense.
There is currently not a planned release date for this game, as I am working on it during my spare time in between work and other hobbies. 
This readme will be updated as the project moves forward.

Thank you for reading!
Will
